#  How did this brand become so famous and popular?

There are many reasons as to why a certain brand becomes popular. But what are the key ingredients or factors that make a certain brand become an instant hit?

#1 It Starts With The Right Idea

The very first step is having the right idea. This means that the company has to do something different, unique and interesting that captures the attention of their target audience. If they can’t get people interested in what they have to offer, then they won’t stand a chance at becoming successful.

An example of a brand that started with the right idea is Apple. They introduced a new type of phone that wasn’t like anything else on the market. And not only did they introduce a new product, but they also had a great marketing campaign that helped them sell their products.

#2 They Have A Strong Marketing Strategy

In order for a brand to become successful, they need to have a strong marketing strategy in place. This means that they need to find the right channels to market their product and reach their target audience. If they don’t put in the work, then it will be difficult for them to make a name for themselves.

An example of a company that has implemented a successful marketing strategy is Nike. They use various channels such as television commercials, online ads, and social media platforms to reach their target audience. And because they’ve been doing this for so many years, it’s helped them build up a large following.

#  What do experts say about 15 Reasons Why Famous Brand?

There are countless reasons why a famous brand might fail, but 15 of the most common are listed below.

1) Lack of innovation: If a company ceases to innovate, it will quickly fall behind its competitors. Famous brands that have failed in this way include BlackBerry, Nokia and Kodak.

2) Poor customer service: Customers are the lifeblood of any business, and if they are not given the best possible service, they will quickly take their business elsewhere. Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas have been known to suffer from this problem.

3) Difficult to compete in a saturated market: It can be very difficult for a brand to make a name for itself in a highly competitive market. Examples of companies that have failed in this way include Blockbuster and Sears.

4) Out-of-date product range: If a company’s products are no longer in demand, it will soon go out of business. Toys “R” Us is a classic example of this.

5) Bad management: One of the main reasons for a company’s failure is poor management. This can be due to bad decisions made by the CEO or board members, or because the wrong people have been put in charge of important departments. Enron is a prime example of this type of failure.

6) High levels of debt: A large amount of debt can be crippling for any company, and often leads to its downfall. Lehman Brothers is a perfect example of this.

7) Not targeting the right audience: If a company markets its products or services to the wrong audience, it is almost guaranteed to fail. Yahoo! is a good example of this – they focused on attracting older users rather than younger ones, which led to their downfall.

8) Inflexible business model: A company that refuses to change with the times is doomed to fail sooner or later. The music industry provides plenty of examples of this – companies such as HMV and Tower Records suffered when digital downloads became popular.

9) Not keeping up with technology: In order to stay ahead of the competition, companies need to continually update their technology. If they don’t, they will quickly lose market share to rivals who are willing to adapt. AOL is a good example of a brand that failed because it didn’t keep up with changing technology trends.
